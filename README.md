# Kingdom Hearts Decompilation

We're currently just targeting the main game executable, which is an elf file `SLPS_251.05` with sha1 `9dabbf867a7ec2a030df99ba1ed969f2deef0488`. 

### Setup

1. Extract `SLPS_251.05` from an ISO of the Kingdom Hearts (JP) and place it in the root of the repo.
2. Run splat with [this branch](https://github.com/ethteck/splat/tree/ps2) on `kh.jp.yaml`.
3. Cry at the lack of file splits, build system, and ridiculous assembler issues
